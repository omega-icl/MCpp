<p>
CPPLapack does not consume any extra memory space 
using its original "Smart-Temporary" system.
On the other hand, ordinary matrix libraries always generate useless 
temporary objects implicitly and consume a lot of extra memory space.
CPPLapack is efficient not only in computing speed 
but also in saving memory space.
</p>


<p>
[NOTE]
Recent advanced compilers automatically optimize 
the way of passing returned objects. 
The steps shown above is the case of the most primitive compiler. 
The performance of ordinary matrix libraries using advanced compilers
becomes close to the performance of CPPLapack.
However, CPPLapack still has some advantages in terms of 
the stepwise elimination, minimization of the number of temporary objects,
and so on.
